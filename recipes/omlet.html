    <img src="omelette.jpg" alt="Denver Omelette on plate and some toast">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The Denver omelet — a diner classic of eggs, bell peppers, onions, 
        ham and often cheese — actually began as a sandwich made with those ingredients in the American West in the late 19th century.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Large eggs</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp of buttler</li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced smoked ham</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp diced onion</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp diced green bell peppers</li>
        <li>Pinch of Salt/Sea Salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.</li>
        <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.
        </li>

    </ol>
